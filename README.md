# Minecraft_ComputerCraft
Our collection of (lua-) scripts for ComputerCraft. 

DISCLAIMER: This is still WORK IN PROGRESS! Parts of the program may not function as intended or expected.

The git.lua script works perfectly though :)


The main branch contains all scripts.
To get started, execute inside CraftOs:

    wget https://raw.github.com/crazyklatsch/Minecraft_ComputerCraft/main/git.lua

After that, the individual scripts can be pulled by executing git.lua with 'get' and the name of the file (or path+name if in folder) as argument.
Example inside CraftOs:

    git get README.md


Directly init a turtle:

    wget https://raw.github.com/crazyklatsch/Minecraft_ComputerCraft/main/turtle_setup.lua
    turtle_setup
